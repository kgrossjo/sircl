# sircl

Simple Information Retrieval using Clojure Language

This is just a toy project to learn Clojure.  It's my first Clojure
program.  It doesn't really do anything yet.

The idea is to take a directory full of text files, then run the
indexer which produces an index of the words in the files.  Given such
an index on disk, a search engine will take a sequence of words and
perform the search and return a ranked list of documents.

At the moment, there are just a couple of unit tests, there is no
main program to run.
