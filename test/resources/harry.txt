I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?
I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?

I leave my whole house and home
My children don't want me no more
Bad talk inside de house dey bring
And when I talk they start to sing

"Mama, look a boo-boo" they shout
Their mother tell them "shut up your mout' "
"That is your daddy", "oh, no"
"My daddy can't be ugly so"
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"

"Mama, look a boo-boo" dey (ooh)
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"
"Mama, look a boo-boo" dey
